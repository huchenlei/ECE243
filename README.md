# ECE243
## Computer Organization
University of Toronto ECE243 2017 S

## Lab 1 ~ 7
Quite basic labs in the similar format as ECE241. Most of them could be easily simulated and debugged using the online simulator except Lab4, which is balancing a LEGO car. The second part could not be easily debugged online since the realtime feedback is needed.

## Project
We implemented an incomplete Regular Expression engine with support on only concatenation and alternation, no closure support is provided. The C code in the project is naive in a Real Compiler/Engine's view, but the main purpose of this project is to control hardware devices in assembly code. We use PS2 keyboard and the VGA display, and got a moderate score at last.

## Please Reference Only (NO DIRECT COPY)
These are the detailed labwork for this course. Handouts are also included in the repository for people who would like to attempt prior to the start of the course. After all, please Reference ONLY, the repo is not for someone who is not willingly to do the prelab.
